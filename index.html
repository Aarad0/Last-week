  <h3>Cloning species</h3>
  Horticulture cloning refers to generating descendants of a single 
plant by vegetative reproduction. Many horticultural plant cultivars are
 clones, that have been derived from a single individual, and then 
multiplied by a process other than sexual reproduction. For example, 
some strains of European grapes are clones that have been propagated for
 over two millennia. Other examples of clones are the potato and banana 
plants.
  Grafting is a technique that is similar to cloning, because the shoots
 and branches from the graft result in the creation of a genetic clone 
of a single individual plant. However, this type of cloning is typically
 classified as an entirely different kind of operation.
